>now trying my hand at a block quote, which may not be too easy because I canâ€™t think of something to say that will occupy more than two lines. And so I push on, trying desperately to think of extensive adverbs and erudite adjectives to fill this block quote out to three lines. Well done, I say. 
>>but perhaps I would like to nest a block quote. It is easier done, than said, at least in these circumstances. Once again I find myself grasping for sentence after sentence in the hopes of stringing together at the very least a four line nested quote. Is it possible? Will I succeed? I should hope so. Yes! It is possible. Only when I strive to fill this blanks space do I find the words that neatly occupy it, row after row after row. 
>And now I can return to the first level of blocked quotes. Perhaps I should add something else within >the first level  block quotes. ##A header, perhaps? 
>No - methinks a list is in order. 
##A list
- the first item
- the second item of the list
- the last item on my list.
